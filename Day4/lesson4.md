### Day 4 Lesson Plan
Today we will focus on adding assests to our game via the Asset Store and polishing up our game.

**Instructor Note** - only allow Low Poly assets to save on game memory. Once assests are loaded, you will have to redo the nav bake so that it updates the nav mesh agent and player navigation. Students have rest of class to import what they want to make the game their own. Help with bug fixes, implementation, and polishing
