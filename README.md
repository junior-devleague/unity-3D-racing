# unity-3D-racing

This is a comphrensive walk through tutorial to build a 3D racing game with Unity. This project is intended for beginner/intermediate students that have not had any experience with Unity or C#. Students should have some background knowledge of proper code structure to make coding scripts easier.

This is a single player game with multiple enemy cars to race. You will help the students construct a basic race track, implement car controls, adjusting a multi-purpose camera rig, adding assests, and assisting with script writing. The goal of this game is to help students create a basic layout with the approriate controls so that they may use their creativity and assest store to make the game their own.
