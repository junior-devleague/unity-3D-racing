### Day 2 Lesson Plan

For today's lesson we will be focusing on creating our initial game environment, and writing scripts for our player movement.

### Steps
1. Building the Track.
  - Create a new 3D **Quad** object.
  - Give this quad the name **"Track"**.
  - Reset the x,y,z positions back to zero.
  - Rotate the track so that is laying flat in your world. **Hint** rotate on the X-axis.
  - Create a new folder named **"Color Materials"**, create a new material for the track and apply it to track.
  - Change the **Scale** values of the track to **x=1000, y=100, z=1**.
